📘 Glossary — Marketing Alchemist

This glossary explains the language, systems, and metaphors used in Marketing Alchemist: Bottle Fill.
Nothing here requires advanced play knowledge—future mechanics are intentionally hinted at, not revealed.

Core Gameplay Terms
Bottle

A vertical container that holds colored segments (elements).
A bottle is solved when it is either:

empty, or

completely full with one single element

Segment

A single colored unit inside a bottle.
Each segment represents one unit of an element.

Pour

A move where you transfer one or more segments from one bottle to another.

Valid pour rules:

Source bottle must not be empty

Target bottle must have space

Target bottle must be empty or match the source’s top element

Invalid Pour

An attempted move that breaks the rules above.
Invalid pours are tracked and influence how the DM interprets your playstyle.

Empty Bottle

A bottle with no segments.
Empty bottles are strategic tools—buffers that allow rearranging stacks safely.

Progression & Structure
Level

A single puzzle board.
Each level is deterministic within a run.

Run

A continuous play session with:

a fixed random seed

persistent DM scheduling

evolving player behavior tracking

Resetting the run regenerates everything.

Act

A loose grouping of levels (roughly every 5 levels).
Acts are mainly used by the DM to contextualize commentary.

The DM & Narrative Systems
DM (Dungeon Master)

Also called The Marketing Alchemist (MA).

An LLM-driven narrator who:

observes how you play

comments on your behavior

sometimes alters future levels via modifiers

The DM does not interfere with the current puzzle.

Minor DM Visit

A DM appearance that provides:

story

critique

warning or advice

No modifier is applied.

Major DM Visit

Occurs every 5th DM appearance.
The DM brews a modifier that affects the next level only.

Modifier

A temporary rule change applied to the next level after a major DM visit.

Modifiers can change:

number of bottles

number of colors

bottle capacity

empty bottles

locked bottles

wildcard slots

Foreshadowing

Narrative warnings from the DM that hint at future consequences
without introducing new mechanics yet.

Foreshadowing adapts to your B.A.N.K profile and begins before advanced play is enabled.

Player Modeling
B.A.N.K

A personality framework (not finance-related) inferred from how you play.

B — Blueprint: values structure, planning, predictability

A — Action: values speed, momentum, decisiveness

N — Nurturing: values safety, reassurance, emotional comfort

K — Knowledge: values logic, understanding, mastery

Your current BANK status influences how the DM speaks to you.

BANK Confidence

A percentage representing how strongly your recent behavior matches your current BANK type.

Sin Tags

Short labels describing recent play patterns (e.g., hesitation, over-reset, indecision).
Used by the DM to tailor commentary and future challenges.

Chemistry System
Element

A colored segment representing a conceptual “ingredient” in the game’s chemistry system.

Each element has:

a role

what it teaches

what it punishes

optional relationships (bonds, conflicts, requirements)

Role

An element’s function within the system.

Foundational – core concepts

Structural – organization & framing

Catalyst – accelerators (often risky)

Transmission – delivery & timing

Conversion – decision-making

Stabilizer – balance & durability

Volatile – high risk, high consequence

Teaches

What good play with this element represents.
(Example: Clarity teaches precision.)

Punishes

What mistake this element exposes when misused.
(Example: Urgency punishes panic.)

Bond

A positive relationship between elements.
Bonded elements tend to work well together conceptually.

Conflict

A negative relationship between elements.
Conflicting elements represent tension or contradiction.

Requires

An element that should accompany another for healthy behavior.

Illegal Without

A special rule meaning an element is conceptually unstable without another.

This becomes important later in the game.

Advanced Concepts (Introduced Later)
Thesis

A named experiment theme describing what is missing or being tested
(e.g., Urgency Without Clarity).

Theses guide:

which elements appear

what the DM comments on

(later) what special constraints may emerge

Illegal Reaction

A situation where an element exists without its required stabilizer.

Early game:

Only referenced narratively

Later game:

May manifest as special constraints

Stabilizer Bottle

A special locked bottle used in advanced levels to contain a stabilizing element.

You are not expected to understand or master this early.
The DM will warn you before it matters.

UI & Feedback
Legend

The panel that explains:

which elements are active

what they teach

what they punish

Reading the legend is part of learning the game.

Toast

A short message displayed near the bottom of the screen to confirm actions, warnings, or outcomes.

Final Note

You do not need to memorize this glossary to play.

The game is designed so that:

mechanics come before consequences

warnings come before enforcement

complexity is earned, not dumped

If something matters later, the DM will tell you—
just not in a way that lets you ignore it.
